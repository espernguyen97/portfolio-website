        For many people, <span style="font-weight: bold">Lẩu Thả  (“Drop” Hot pot) </span> is probably still a new dish. It’s actually a specialty
          of  <span style="font-weight: bold">Phan Thiet </span>, the capital of  <span style="font-weight: bold">Bình Thuận Province </span> on the southeast coast in Vietnam. This hot pot
          originates from the philosophy of  <span style="font-weight: bold">yin and yang</span> in the 5 elements.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Lẩu Thả</span> with <span style="font-weight: bold">5 colors (white, blue, black,

          "drop" each ingredient placed in the petal of banana flower into the hot pot. The whole process of preparing,

      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">
        If you have a trip to the southern of Vietnam, do not miss the famous hot pot of this region. <span style="font-weight: bold">Lẩu Mắm </span> the
        combination of the broth cooked with fermented fish paste with seafood, meat and different kinds of spices as
        well as vegetables
        from the West of Vietnam such as <span style="font-weight: bold"> keo neo (limnocharis flava), sung flower (Nymphaea lotus), banana flower, eggplant,
          water lily stem, yellow velvetleaf, pumpkin flower, greens, winged bean, sesbania grandiflora flower </span>.
          <img src="./img/laumam12.png " alt="mamhotpot" class="anh" id="anh">
        The regional fish sauce serves as the hot pot's soul. Southerners frequently pick carefully brewed fish sauce
        while preparing a tasty hot pot. Young <span style="font-weight: bold">linh fish (mustached danio) or sac fish (snakeskin
        gourami) </span>, caught during the flood season, are commonly used to make the best fish sauce.
        <img src="./img/mam.jpg " alt="mamhotpot" class="anh" id="anh">
        The broth of the dish is made of fermented fish paste of the fish sauce. <span style="font-weight: bold">Sugar, minced lemongrass, and green onion </span> are used as
        seasonings.
        To further improve the flavor of the hot pot, <span style="font-weight: bold">shrimps, squids, eel and roasted pork </span> are added. The fermented fish
        paste gives the broth its salty flavour while coconut water add the sweetness to the hot pot. This hot can also
        be
        served with a variety of fish from the Mekong Delta, including <span style="font-weight: bold"> red snapper, snakehead fish, or basa fish </span>.
        <img src="./img/lau-mam.jpg " alt="mamhotpot" class="anh" id="anh">
        <span style="font-weight: bold"> Chili </span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">lemongrass </span>  are essential in this hot pot because they help eliminate the smell of the river fish.
        In addition, the proportion of fermented fish paste and water must be equal to maintain the
        broth's balanced flavour and prevent it from becoming overly salty.

      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">
        Going to the city of red phoenix flowers – <span style="font-weight: bold">Hải Phong</span>, you will be treated <span style="font-weight: bold">Lẩu Riêu Cua Đồng </span> - a very
        special paddy crab hot pot. The main ingredient in this dish is the <span style="font-weight: bold">rice field crabs </span>, rather than the luxurious
        sea crabs or any other seafood. <span style="font-weight: bold">Rice field crab </span> is a a well-known ingredient since many Vietnamese farmers
        made their living by haphazardly catching crabs in fields, ponds, or rivers in the past.

        <img src="./img/lau-cua.jpg " alt="crabhotpot" class="anh" id="anh">
        Hot pot's flavours, which are mild yet well-balanced with crab flavour, not overly greasy but slightly sour and
        sweet, are perhaps what make it so appealing. Traditionally, <span style="font-weight: bold">pork bones </span> are used to make the broth (pork bone is
        boiled for many hours so that the broth is naturally sweet). The <span style="font-weight: bold">crab paste (riêu) </span> melts as soon as it reaches
        your tongue, but the crab flavour would last until you finished the dish. The crab combination (riêu) is sautéed
        with  <span style="font-weight: bold">tomatoes </span>, adding to a subtle sour and sweetness of this hot pot.
