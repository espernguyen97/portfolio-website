      <p class="first-text" id="introduction"><br>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">McDonald's has been the leader in the fast-food industry for decades, and
        nowadays, it has over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 nations. Due to the innovations implemented, such as the
        re-franchising of restaurants and new technology, the company generated an average of USD 5.272 billion from
        2015 to 2019 (S. Lock, 2021). Mcdonald's started developing and expanding into global markets beginning in 1967,
        followed by the first two locations: Canada and Puerto Rico (McDonald's, 2021). In 1975, McDonald's established
        its first location in Hong Kong, and the company opened its first location in Shenzhen in 1990. During the 90s,
        Shenzhen was recognized as a special economic zone (many business opportunities) and very close to Hong Kong,
        which means McDonald's Hong Kong can easily supply McDonald's Shenzhen. By the time McDonald's decided to
        conquer the Chinese market, KFC was only one main competitor. In 1999, KFC had 37 stores in Beijing and 500
        stores in China. In the same year, McDonald’s had only 370 stores in China.
        <br>Fast-forward to today, KFC has approximately 5300 stores in China, and McDonald’s only has 2500 stores
        (Jacobs, 2019). KFC expanded evenly throughout the small, midsize and big cities, while McDonald’s focused more
        on the midsize to big cities (Bell & Shelman, 2014). These two companies implemented two different strategies,
        and the result changed. As of 2016, McDonald's market share of 5.6% is far behind the 11.6% that KFC holds in
        the market (Jacobs, 2019). What makes McDonald's situation in the Chinese market completely different from its
        position in the international market? In this report, the difficulty McDonald's encountered since entering the
        Chinese market will be discussed in the first section. The project report will later address an analysis of the
        issue in the second section. Then, two strategic options will be reviewed on how McDonald's can alter its
        products to cater to the Chinese market in the third and fourth sections. Finally, a recommendation of the
        strategic options and conclusion will be explained in the last section of the report.

      </p>

      <p class="first-text" id="issues"> <br>ISSUES</p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">With the rise of globalization, multinational corporations (MNCs) such as
        McDonald’s are growing their worldwide footprint, bringing their products and brands to new and diversified
        customers in emerging nations. The vast number of prospective customers in emerging economies like China creates
        the prospect of unprecedented demand with high growth potential, but only if the appropriate items could be
        delivered in the right places. This poses both opportunities and challenges for MNCs in emerging China. To
        achieve success in this market, multinational corporations must have a plan to establish product and brand
        portfolios that match their competencies with local needs as they adapt their tactics and even business model to
        the local situation. Among all products, food is one of the most challenging items to standardize or adapt. Food
        is a tough product class to work with because eating habits are firmly and emotionally rooted in a nation’s
        culture. There are also significant variances geographically, internationally and inside each community group.
        Therefore, whether to standardize or adapt their products is a considerable challenge for McDonald’s in China.

      </p>
      <p class="first-text" id="analysis"><br>ADAPTATION VS. STANDARDIZATION ANALYSIS </p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">
        To illustrate McDonald’s major challenge in the Chinese fast food industry, the fascinating case of the
        fast-food war between McDonald’s and KFC in China is considered because it has clearly experienced distinctive
        strategies of the two corporations as well as McDonald’s main problem in the last decade.

        <br>
        In this case, both McDonald’s and KFC are American fast-food giants. McDonald's has long dominated the
        international market, but in China, KFC is the king. In fact, KFC now has about 6,000 locations in more than
        1,100 cities, accounting for 11.6 percent of China's fast-food market, while McDonald's has only 250 locations
        and a 5.6 percent market share (Jacobs, 2019).
        <br>
        Despite the huge difference in cuisine, culture between the US and China, and the trend towards healthy eating
        habits in China, KFC, one of America’s largest fast-food chains, won this food fight with McDonald’s and gained
        a significant market share in China. This happens due to the fact that they chose to adapt, and their adaptation
        was better and faster. KFC wants customers to think of them as a part of the local community, not as a fast-food
        chain selling pricey Western-style food, but as restaurants with a mix of traditional Western and Chinese
        dishes. They have 50 items on their menus to appeal to Chinese preferences and urge them to eat at KFC for
        breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a late-night snack. With their leadership entirely made up of Chinese managers who
        could fully understand the local market and the restaurant industry, KFC recognized what customers needed, where
        there was untapped demand. KFC was willing to expand into areas where McDonald's did not.

        <br>
        In China, KFC is significantly more than just a western fast-food chain specializing in fried chicken. Gaining
        knowledge of local cuisine from their local managers, KFC knows that the customers in Sichuan, Hunan and
        Chongqing preferred spicy dishes. At the same time, there is much lower demand for these same spicy dishes for
        Shanghai customers. Hence, they came up with mystery sauce mixed with ingredients as well as raw materials
        bought locally, and they changed their recipe to suit each region and attract more potential customers.

        <br>
        Furthermore, with their rapid expansion strategy, KFC was not only a first-mover into smaller cities but also an
        intelligent first-mover adapting its practices and menu to match the Chinese situation. Understanding that
        breakfast is an essential aspect of Chinese culture, KFC added a range of Chinese breakfast options in the early
        2000s, including soy milk drinks and congee, which is now still their best-selling breakfast item.
        <br>
        Compared to McDonald’s, KFC uses a differentiated targeting strategy that focuses its market on both children
        and adults, and KFC's menu evolved quickly to keep up with the ever-changing demand. In the past decade, the
        trend of health awareness has grown, which has urged Chinese consumers to consider pursuing a healthy lifestyle
        and emphasizing the nutritional value of dishes and foods. Following this trend, besides their famous fried
        chicken, KFC offers healthier options with more salads on menus.
        <br>
        They also target people with a busy lifestyle who have no time to cook but still want to enjoy healthy,
        home-style food; therefore, they added rice-based meals for lunch and dinner. Because of that, they became the
        first western fast-food brand to have rice-based meals on the menu. Their stores with convenient locations along
        with exciting menus make it possible for Chinese customers to enjoy breakfast, lunch, and dinner at KFC. In
        addition, their new brand K Pro targets China's health-conscious consumers, particularly the white-collar market
        sector, which will be an advantage in their strategy over the long run.

        <br>
        On the other hand, McDonald’s acts as a foreign, non-Chinese brand bringing American fast food to China and
        reminds customers of ‘Western luxury restaurants’. Usually, foreign entrants mostly pick one of three strategies
        when entering China: Firstly, Global branding - a premium brand that is positioned as a global brand with little
        or no adaptation; secondly, Local branding - a collection of local brands set to appeal to a broad audience; and
        lastly, Multi-tier branding - a collection of global, regional, and local brands positioned to service diverse
        market sectors. McDonald’s is recognized as a global brand with many advantages and successes in its home base
        and many countries, including China. With the famous global name of McDonald’s and their international
        dominance, they have both the American influence on culture as well as cuisine, and the ability to express the
        brand's values and provide high-quality service worldwide. McDonald’s reputation and success depended on core
        products, their highly standardized food production practices, western scientific recipes, and modern management
        techniques. McDonald's efforts toward process repetition and efficiency lay the foundation for its success in
        terms of consumer expectations and help it stay on top in the fast-food industry. Customers know what to expect
        and may rely on that information when choosing to eat at McDonald’s.

        <br>
        Obviously, to guarantee their consistently high-quality products and continuous success across the global
        market, McDonald’s insistence on worldwide product standardization is reasonable. However, it can be seen that
        the Chinese diet and eating practices are highly different from those of Americans, from the food they eat, to
        how it's cooked and even the way it's eaten. Indeed, locals may take some time to accept conventional Western
        cuisine such as burgers, and the trend of healthy awareness in younger consumers in their diet is rising in
        China, which will pose threats to McDonald’s strategy targeting youth and families. McDonald’s was so successful
        with existing recipes when expanding into other markets, so they avoided any deviation from their menu and were
        unwilling to innovate. They just copied the same recipes with American-sized portions of high-fat, high-calorie,
        high-sugar when they entered China, thinking they could apply their business model everywhere.

        <br>
        It has to be mentioned that maintaining consistency in their core business model and strict food production
        practices do not imply that the products they sell must remain unchanged. McDonald's struggles in China because
        the company does not offer the type of food or brand positioning that Chinese consumers desire. Obviously,
        standardization of products in China and too little adaptation in their menu prevent McDonald’s from quickly
        responding to the changeable Chinese market as well as their client preferences and tastes. Once they fail to
        deliver appropriate products to the right markets, McDonald’s’ strengths analyzed above can be easily overcome
        by the numerous advantages and positions held by other strong competitors. Consistency and innovation appear to
        contradict one another, but they must be synchronized to ensure McDonald's’ continuous success and growth in
        China's market. McDonald’s already has established a solid base and framework for food production processes from
        which to build on. They simply just need to alter their products to better serve their customers without causing
        disruptions.
        <br>
        Next, when comparing the recent KFC and McDonald’s menu options in the Chinese market, Mcdonald’s menu has
        relatively fewer options than KFC and still offers very few Chinese dishes. When it comes to McDonald’s
        effective localization limits, the problem lies in the fact that China’s McDonald’s is under the strict
        management of US headquarters and China’s leadership is heavily reliant on American managers. This has led to
        slow adaptation decisions and slower customizations of their menu to local taste.
        <br>
        McDonald’s came to China in 1990, but it took them a really long time to localize its menu, and when they did,
        most of their adaptation efforts proved to be unsuccessful and less effective. It was only in 2017 that they
        finally had congee to meet the tastes of Chinese consumers while KFC already had it in the early 2000s. Their
        attempt to offer more healthy options by adding more vegetables to core products such as burgers is also more
        applicable to countries with fast food culture like the US, but there is not much variation in China.
        <br>
        Moreover, although the new menu includes rice bowls, rice-based food, congee and products inspired by Chinese
        cuisine, the US-based corporation hasn't been as enthusiastic about adapting its recipes for the Chinese market.
        Many recent efforts have received much criticism for their misguided adaptation efforts. For example, in 2013,
        their Rice Fun Wrap was launched, and many customers considered it more as a “vegetarian hand-roll with a slice
        of chicken someone accidentally dropped in the kitchen” (Florcruz, 2013). Next, in January 2021, their new item
        is an interpretation of Roujiamo, a Shaanxi-style meat-between-bun Chinese "burger" from the northern region.
        When the Chinese burger debuted on McDonald's menus, customers posted thousands of Roujiamo pictures and
        negative comments on social media, pointing out various flaws of this item. McDonald's issue of the new item is
        primarily with the stuffing consisting of chicken breast meat shreds and chunks, which is different from a
        traditional filling. Chinese customers are pickier when it comes to the food they grew up with, especially
        regional specialties. Therefore, there is a high risk for failure when McDonald’s tries to impress Chinese
        consumers with something profoundly ingrained in Chinese culinary culture if the company does not put much of
        their time, effort and money into it.

        <br>
        Bear in mind that the ability to adapt to local tastes not only contributes to both KFC and McDonald’s success,
        but their attempts to adapt in China also go much beyond their superb food and profit. Their primary functions
        have to be to identify and satisfy the customers’ desires, and enhance the value of the corporations. When
        businesses know what customers want, it's an opportunity for them to expand and strengthen bonds with customers
        in the future. Above all, what Chinese customers can see at KFC but not at McDonald’s are proper localization
        efforts, cuisine exchange with many menu options combined of Chinese and Western-style, diversification, and
        genuine respect to culture and customer demand.

        <br>
        In sum, McDonald’s needs to better connect with local communities and have a better menu to appeal to more
        Chinese customers. They have to work harder to localize their menus, innovate their products, and still keep
        their core competencies.
      </p>
      <p class="first-text" id="options"><br>STRATEGIC OPTIONS </p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">
        <span style="font-weight: bold"> Strategic Option 1: McBoba</span>
        <br>
        McDonald's should use its capacity and strength to adapt to the local needs of the Chinese people successfully
        and efficiently. This multinational corporation has several advantages in both their home base and China,
        including a well-known brand name, high-quality customer service and satisfaction, ownership of a number of
        critical locations in wealthy areas, and effective promotional plans. In general, the brand name and reputation
        of McDonald’s is their most powerful asset, which distinguishes the corporation from the competition in the fast
        food market. Their global branding and their position as a western premium brand remind Chinese customers of
        unwavering standards, highly standardized western food production procedures, western scientific recipes, and
        modern management techniques.

        <br>
        However, with little room for adaptation in their core menus, they fail to respond to local tastes and
        preferences. This strategy prevents the corporation from being innovative, unique and also limits their ability
        to reach out to more comprehensive potential customers, rather than just children and families. In this
        situation, it will be extremely tough for McDonald’s to change their global branding strategy and core products
        entirely in China.

        <br>
        Still, the company can engage in brand extensions to some of their successful products only made for the China
        market. In China, besides the regular menu, the company has successfully delivered several new products and
        baked goods. Surprisingly, the most recognized and successful localization efforts are red bean pie, pineapple
        pie, taro pie and boba tea. The company received much positive feedback from Chinese customers for these
        products. From that, it can be seen that McDonald's needs to have a plan to establish more innovative products
        like this and adjust their recipes to local situations. When looking at various products of McDonald's position
        in the BCG matrix, particularly in the Chinese market, it is no surprise that Big Mac is McDonald's cash cow, as
        it is one of the company's most popular products. McDonald's sells over 550 million big macs per year worldwide,
        and big macs are in solid demand even in the Chinese market (Kaur, R., Kaur, G., Kaur K., Pasaei M., & Sidhu.,
        K., 2016).

        <br>
        However, this cash cow can be hard to use in all areas in China since small cities and towns would be very
        different from big and wealthy cities regarding population, fast food demand and competition. In fact, there is
        a huge difference in culture in the US and China, and even traditional Chinese cuisine differs from Western
        cuisine, so it may take some time for the locals in these areas to accept typical Western cuisine such as
        burgers.

        <br>
        For this case, McCafe beverages and its bakery goods are a star for McDonald's because China's population
        includes more older people, increasing the demand for beverages. On the other hand, as the working population
        grows, so does the demand for beverages such as smoothies, which are an essential part of their breakfast. In
        addition, there is a much higher demand for tea and bubble tea consumption, while both adults and children love
        baked goods.
        With that in mind, a new brand, McBoba, may be established, prioritizing tea, bubble tea, pastries and
        considering maintaining only a few burger options. In short, branding can play a significant role in
        standardization versus adaptation. Family brands such McBoba in McDonald’s products’ line are useful in
        persuading consumers that each McDonald’s product has the same quality and meets McDonald’s strict food
        standards. This brand can also be used as part of a market segmentation strategy in multiple market segments
        inside China, which involves selling the successful innovative products along with the core products that are
        harder for the locals to consume. McCafe beverages and its bakery goods have already been in McDonald's stores
        in big and wealthy areas so McBoba targets smaller markets such as small cities and even towns.

        <br>
        Knowing which innovative products are successful and suitable, McDonald’s needs to find ways to keep these
        quality products and expand them along with core items throughout China. McBoba seems to be an appropriate
        strategy because even if the core products such burgers are standardized, this brand can be leveraged to meet
        the certain management's goal to satisfy unique market needs.
        <br>
        For adaptation and innovation, adapting McBoba and McDonald's products by adding local specialties to McDonald’s
        existing recipes can save them some efforts on their novel recipe creation and their strict western food
        production and testing. Taking huge capital and resources from McDonald’s, McBoba can buy these local fruits and
        use them in McDonald’s existing recipes for pies and beverages as they did with their successful pineapple pie,
        bubble tea,..These innovative products perfectly combine both Chinese and Western styles and flavours. China has
        various fresh fruits and each fruit is grown in different seasons. McBoba can offer these baked goods
        seasonally. When it’s out of that fruit season, they can try similar fruit with similar taste or switch to a
        completely different fruit pie. Jujube pie, chestnut pie and pear pie are some suggestions to be considered
        since these delicious fruits are native to China.

        <br>
        In addition, local fruits can be combined with tea and other beverages to attract broad locals to come and spend
        time at stores. Creating different fruits products in distinctive fruit seasons makes their products frequently
        innovative and hard to imitate. Also, in a country where the government actively regulates economics, buying
        from locals helps them keep their costs low, connect more with local farmers and communities, and strengthen the
        parent company’s relationship with the Chinese government.

        <br>
        Next, with the smart expansion and localization strategy, KFC is able to expand quickly into smaller cities and
        towns. McDonald’s has always been one step slower than KFC in terms of locations and food menus. If McDonald’s
        insists on using standardized products and little adaptation in their menu, there is a high risk of failure when
        they decide to expand to smaller cities and towns, following KFC expansions.

        <br>
        Not to mention, it might take a really long time to find a location big enough to build McDonald’s restaurants
        there. Therefore, multiple smaller McBoba stores near schools, office parks, in buildings near community centres
        of these areas are prioritized to test the reaction of broad clients to McDonald’s core items and help them to
        access more innovative products. However, it will be unavoidable that some customers may only come for beverages
        and baked goods so McBoba should have promotions to encourage them to try core items such as beef burgers. When
        they choose a combo of 1 drink with 1 burger or 1 drink with 1 pie, discounts on the combo or coupons for
        next-time burger purchase at our stores are given to customers. Suppose this model is successful and McDonald’s
        knows their local fast food demand and tastes, they can consider opening bigger McDonald’s restaurants and
        adjust their food menu to cater more towards local consumer taste.

        <br>
        In general, when investing in McBoba menu, McDonald's will get involved with the community and enhance their
        corporation value by valuing local fruits and promoting both Western and Chinese cuisine better and more
        actively. With their global name and international dominance, McDonald’s already had more advantages than many
        competitors in China. Hopefully, through McBoba, McDonald's can adapt effectively and efficiently to tackle
        their major problem and start to win more Chinese customers' love.

        <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold"> Strategic Option 2: McFresh</span>
        <br>
        K Pro is an extension of KFC in China. K Pro is targeted at the health-conscious consumers of China,
        specifically the white-collar market segment of China. They sell quinoa, salmon, salads, and many other healthy
        food options. They have also rebranded themselves on a completely new level as they stepped away from their
        iconic red and white branding. Instead, they embody the health-conscious palettes of Chinese consumers through a
        green and white theme, with branding quotes stating words such as “Tasty,” “Fresh'' and ''Ready.”

        <br>
        KPro is a classic example of a company pursuing and executing the strategy of adaptation, specifically in China.
        When a globalized company such as KFC has to decide whether to adapt or standardize, they must evaluate six
        factors: Competitive factors, Market Factors, Nature of Products, Economies of Scale, International Involvement
        and Company Resources.

        <br>
        As discussed in the earlier sections of the paper it is clear that McDonald’s in China is behind KFC in terms of
        market share capitalization among fast-food chains. Thus, at this juncture prior to competing with KFC,
        McDonald’s must evaluate the same six factors mentioned in the preceding paragraph to determine if it would be a
        logical and rational approach.
        <br>
        The potential solution that McDonald’s can create to compete with the likes of KFC’s K Pro would be an extension
        of McDonald’s called McFresh. McFresh would be an identical competitor to K Pro, serving health-conscious items
        on their menu targeting the 1st tier cities that K Pro has established itself in, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou and
        Beijing.
        <br>
        The first factor involves competition, and this is the most significant factor when analyzing whether Mcdonald’s
        should open up McFresh in China. KFC has adapted their products in China and has even gone one step further
        through KPro, as discussed above. Therefore, even disregarding all of the local competitors, McDonald’s must
        open up a McFresh if it wants to keep up with KFC and K Pro.

        <br>
        Market factors such as growth potential and consumer preferences in China indicate there is a space for McFresh,
        as K Pro has settled in many capital cities across China focusing on white-collar consumers. In terms of
        Westernization and the foreign consumer experience a global brand offers, the market is still seen and viewed as
        an opportunity for consumers to experience America whilst still in China. Therefore, McDonald’s can still
        compete with K Pro with its own take on health-conscious items.
        <br>
        The nature of the products that McFresh would bring would be similar to K Pro; however, there is an opportunity
        to attract consumers using the brand that McDonald’s has already established in China.
        <br>
        Economies of scale would indicate that standardization would be the best approach, however, company resources
        and international involvement should be analyzed. China was the 53rd country that McDonald’s entered into
        signifying the vast company and financial resources they have at their disposal. In fact, McDonald’s is the
        first mover of the fast-food industry and has capitalized on a global scale in many countries. China remains one
        of the only countries where they have not established the dominant share of the market. Therefore, adaptation
        can be something that McDonald’s can pursue.

        <br>
        McDonald’s has always been reactive to KFC in many stages of its growth. McFresh would also be another reactive
        step to try and compete for market share with KFC. Additionally, it would only be targeting an extremely
        specific market segment: white-collar consumers, trending towards health-conscious diets.

        <br>
        However, the power of McDonald’s global brand and their significant financial resources lend a hand to their
        ability to compete with KFC in China. Although it will not happen immediately, McFresh may be a viable approach
        to attempt to displace KFC as the premium global fast-food chain in China.
        <br>
        The extension of McDonald’s into McFresh and McBoba are also examples of related diversification which can help
        McDonald’s create and establish Operational synergy. As mentioned, McDonald’s has always been reactive compared
        to the steps KFC has taken in China. Therefore, the operational synergy created through the extensions of
        McFresh and McBoba would aid McDonald’s in potentially taking the first step to go beyond just following the
        steps KFC has taken. Instead, it will help share multiple knowledge resources between the various food products
        and may inspire innovation specifically catered to local consumer tastes and preferences.

        <br>
        Additionally, the creations of McBoba and McFresh may finally lead to a re-positioned view of McDonald’s in
        China. McDonald’s entered China based on a view of global branding, feeling that they did not need to adapt or
        cater to local preferences. They stuck to their scientific and methodically created menu items, while resisting
        the need to adapt to local consumer tastes. KFC on the other hand has adopted a local brand strategy as
        previously stated, creating over 50 items.
        <br>
        Therefore, to obtain a competitive advantage it is imperative that McDonald’s adopt a Multi-tier strategy to
        ensure that they are able to serve multiple market segments. This will allow McDonald’s to maintain their
        globally renowned and recognized products such as the “Big Mac”, while also implementing and innovating
        different products according to different regions and localities in China. Seasonal fruits for example may
        provide the opportunity to establish uniqueness in the products that McDonald’s may be able to create, while
        catering to the local consumers.

      <p class="first-text" id="recommendation"><br>RECOMMENDATION </p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">
        The popularity of bubble tea in China has been well proven; the bubble tea stores in China made over 21 billion
        USD annual sales in 2019 (Noel, 2020). More brands are starting a business in the Chinese beverage market in
        recent years, with almost 480,000 bubble tea shops in 2020 (Noel, 2020). But the leading bubble tea and pies
        brands in the market are feeble compared to a multinational brand Mcdonald's. With that being said, strategy
        option one is recommended in this report, opening up McBoba as a subsidiary to expand McDonald's market share
        and potential customers.
        <br>
        The first consideration is the perspective of product-related diversification. According to McDonald's Chinese
        website, there is only one flavour of bubble tea on the McDonald's menu. McDonald's knows the importance of
        bubble tea, so the company builds various combos and meals around bubble tea (McDonald's CN, 2021). But only one
        flavour of bubble tea is not going to cater to a more comprehensive market. The other bubble tea brands in the
        market have numerous flavours, such as CoCo China has over 60 different flavours and styles. By starting a
        subsidiary, McBoba, McDonald's should focus on having R&D on developing more bubble tea and tea flavours to
        compete with other mature brands. As successful related products are made for the China market under McDonald's
        product line , the company would have the advantage of using operational synergy to develop more innovative
        drinks and pies. The creative drinks from McBoba could be an effective weapon to end the war in the beverage
        market supported by a strong brand reputation. In addition, with more innovative products added to McBoba's
        menu, the local consumers will notice what business McDonald’s has, and the brand could take more market share
        from its biggest rival, KFC and other local competitors.
        <br>
        The second consideration is the economy of scale. To compete against its main competitor KFC, McDonald's should
        keep up with the number of stores KFC has in China; eventually, the higher market share would help the company
        alleviate the cost. Opening McBoba is nothing like opening a McDonald's restaurant in terms of cost. McBoba
        should be small in size and require fewer employees. The total investment of opening McBoba will be less
        expensive than opening McFresh, and it is also easier to control in terms of financial risk. With more McBoba
        opened throughout cities with different sizes, the market share increases, along with the cost evenly spreading
        into more units, leaving more room for profit.
        <br>
        These two considerations would help McBoba and McDonald's have competitive advantages over the competitors. The
        competitive advantages are why it will be believed to best help McDonald's with the current situation in the
        market. McFresh would also help McDonald's to be differentiated in the fast-food industry. McFresh is considered
        a reactive strategy for McDonald's to compete at the same level as KFC since the launch of KFC Pro. However, it
        will still need more data and information to decide whether the health-conscious subsidiary option is profitable
        for the long term. When comparing the two strategic options, it can be argued that McBoba would provide a better
        outcome than McFresh due to the competitive advantages to meet the local taste, as discussed above.

      </p>

      <p class="first-text" id="conclusion"><br>CONCLUSION </p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">
        As mentioned at the beginning of the report, Mcdonald's has extreme internal strengths, such as its
        transnational brand reputation, the leading global position in the fast-food industry, and substantial capital.
        The Chinese market, on the other hand, has enormous potential for an international brand to exploit. Combining
        the internal strengths with the external opportunities and the observations found when determining why
        McDonald's does not show their competitiveness in the Chinese market is mainly due to their adaptation
        performance. The two strategic options are a combination of proactive and reactive strategies. McBoba is a
        better strategy to cater to the Chinese market. Sources showed that the market would positively react towards
        the bubble tea, tea and baked goods business due to the massive demand and high competition (S. Lock, 2021).
        This strategy focuses on adapting effectively in the market and creating the economy of scale for the company to
        one side, gaining the market shares, and reducing their costs to compete against their competitors who have more
        retails than McDonald's. McFresh, as a reactive plan, is to follow the lead of KFC KPro to prevent the
        first-mover advantage from being taken by KFC. Since the KFC has already launched the K pro, there are
        advantages that McDonald's could utilize the information and mimic the existing product from KFC to enhance the
        McFresh. Learning from this case, adaptation and standardization can be crucial factors for a giant global
        company like McDonald's when it comes to decision-making, especially when facing a foreign market with enormous
        cultural differences.
