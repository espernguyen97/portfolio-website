      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">This project was a part of ADMS 3511 Business Analytics course at York
        University. The dataset contains all employee data retrieved from HR department, which includes name, personal
        information, employees' perception of collaboration and competition in the organization's culture, years of
        experience, last performance evaluation, number of projects, number of working hours, employee satisfaction,
        work accidents. The data is openly available on Google Drive: <a

      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text"> XYZ is a multinational corporation with more than 14,850 employees. XYZ has
        decided to analyze its human resources (HR) data looking for useful insight. The attached data set includes HR
        data for all XYZ employees. You can find a table that includes descriptions of the variables in the data set at
        the end of this file.
        <br>
        Use Tableau Desktop to create the charts and the dashboard asked in the following questions. Subsequently write
        a managerial report to discuss your findings from the charts.
        <br>
        1. Create a bar chart to show average “Last performance evaluation” for employees in different departments and
        different countries. Bars for different countries should have different colors. Add single view (i.e., radio
        button) filters for gender.
        (Hint: Use Department as rows. Use Country and Last performance evaluation as columns).
        <br>
        2. Create a clustered column chart that depicts the average of “Employee's perception of competition in the
        organization’s culture” and the average of “Employee's perception of collaboration in the organization’s
        culture” for employees in different departments. Make sure to use different colors for “Employee's perception of
        competition in the organization’s culture” and “Employee's perception of collaboration in the organization’s
        culture”.
        (Hint: use Department as columns)
        <br>
        3. Create a GIS that shows the average “Percent remote” and average “Employee’s satisfaction with working
        remote” for different countries as labels. Also, countries with different levels of average “percent remote”
        should have different colors.
        <br>
        4. Create a treemap that separates the employees into their “Departments” and uses size to represent each
        department’s sum of “Number of projects”. Use both “Department” and sum of “Number of projects” as labels.
        <br>
        5. Create a dashboard of the charts made for questions 1 and 4 above. Make sure that the entire dashboard (i.e.,
        both charts) can be filtered based on Gender simultaneously (i.e., with one filter).

      <p class="first-text" id="first-text">Conclusion: </p>
      <p class="sc-text" id="sc-text">These charts and dashboards give an insight into Human Resources of XYZ in
        different deparments
        in different
        countries. It can be seen that UK, Australia, Japan have both very high
        Percent Remote and high Satisfaction with Working Remote while the lowest ones are China, US
        and Columbia. <br>
        For these leading countries, as the rating of Employee Satisfaciton with Working
        Remote increase, employees are willing to have more their work done remotely. For USA, not
        only the rating of Satisfaciton with Working Remote is lowest, but the average Performance
        Evaluation is also lower compared to other countries. Except for Finance, Human Resources,
        Management and Sales departments, the average Performance Evaluation in other departments in
        US are rated below 5 on a 10-point scale, which requires XYZ to enhance all employees’
        performance in USA. <br>
        In terms of Performance appraisal, a common pattern shared by all
        countries is that Finance accounts for the highest rating, then the second position belong to Management, Sales
        and HR
        and the lowest is IT, which will need more improvement in this department. Support and Warehouse have
        similarities in
        Performance evaluation and Number of Projects. Sales has the most projects and the least is
        Management, which might be related to the nature and function of Sales department in an
        organization. <br>
        Regarding to Projects and Performance by Gender, Number of Projects of women
        in all departments are always higher than that of men. Although more works are assigned to
        women, average Performance evaluation of men in major departments : Sales, and Management,
        is rated higher than that of women. IT and Operations both have highest average of Perception of
        collaboration level and a lower average of Perception of competition level. Support has low
        Perception of the Collaboration level but obtains the highest Perception of the competition level.
        Overall, except for Warehouse and HR, the average Perception of the level of collaboration is
        inversely proportional to the average Employees’s Perception of Competition level in
        organization’s culture. It’s suggested to to balance these levels for best organization’s culture.</p>
